3. Non-Functional Requirements
    a. Performance
        1. All core operations (CRUD, dashboard load) should respond in < 300ms under normal conditions.
        2. Payroll batch generation for <= 1000 employees must complete within 2 minutes.
    b. Scalability
        1. System must support up to 5000 employees without major redesign.
    c. Security
        1. Role-based access control (RBAC) for sensitive modules (payroll, documents).
        2. Passwords stored using Argon2 hashing.
        3. Audit logs for CRUD operations.
    d. Reliability
        1. System should recover gracefully from crashes (auto-save, transaction rollback).
        2. Critical operations (payroll, leave approval) must be atomic.
    e. Usability
        1. Clean, intuitive UI with minimal training required.
        2. Consistent navigation across modules.
    f. Maintainability
        1. Modular architecture (separate components for employee, payroll, attendance, etc.).
        2. Code should follow agreed naming conventions and linting rules.
    g. Lazy Loading (Optimization)
        1. Components, pages, and data requests must be lazily loaded to improve perceived performance.
            Example: Employee list loads on demand with pagination/infinite scroll.

4. Acceptance Criteria
    a. Users can perform CRUD on employees with full validation and persistence.
    b. Payroll can be generated for at least 1 department with correct tax / deductions.
    c. Attendance logs can be stored and summarize per employee, time entry.
    d. HR dashboard shows at least 3 visualize KPIs (Key Performance Indicator).
    e. Lazy Loading must be applied in at least.
        1. Employee list view.
